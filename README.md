v# organize-filetypes

fileorganizer.py is a Python script to organize files into folders based on their file types.

If you would like to oragnize the files into different folder names, or differently based on file type you will need to edit the FILE_CATEGORIES portion of the code on line 8 through 16.

The use case of this is to quickly organize large amounts of files into organized folders without having to do it manually.

The versatility of Python can also be appealing to system administrators who manage both macOS and Windows systems. Normally, you’d need to write a PowerShell script for Windows and a Bash script for macOS—but using Python allows you to create one script that works across both platforms, saving time and effort.

When you run the program, it will prompt you in the terminal to specify which path you would like to have organized: 
<br>
<img width="1212" height="93" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0edcab38-1051-4df8-821c-38629d39b716" />

Specify with the exact path example: <br>
C:\Users\username\Pictures if you would like to organize that user's pictures.
